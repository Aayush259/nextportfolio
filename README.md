# Next Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project built using Next.js with a focus on learning React/Tanstack Query. The portfolio showcases my work, skills, and allows users to contact me through a form.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: The UI is animated and built using Acertinity UI components, heavily customized for better user experience.

- **Sections**:
    1. **Home**: A simple introduction with animations.
    2. **Projects**: A showcase of my projects with hover effects.
    3. **About**: A brief section about me.
    4. **Contact**: A form allowing users to send me a message, powered by React Query and React Hook Form.

- **Contact Form**:
    - Users can submit their name, email, and message.
    - Email validation is implemented using React Hook Form and React Query.
    - The form checks if the email is already taken and prevents the same email from being used again.
